# MEMA

The MEMA package will include functions to preprocess, QA, normalize and explore Microenvironment Microarray (MEMA) experiments. 
MEMAs are spotted cellular microarrays that are imaged at the population or cell level. Each spot can have different conditions,
making them an individual experiment. A MEMA typically has 1000-4000 spots. The arrays or subarrays are in wells that expose
the spots to common conditions such as cell type, media and drug. Wells can be in 384 well plates which typically hold 25 spots
or in 4 well plates that can hold an array of ~4000 spots.

The cells are stained with up to four antibodies that typically target DNA and specific proteins.
